Table Creation

Create table Location (locationid number primary key, name varchar2(30), sunlight number, water number); 
Create table Gardener (gardenerid number primary key, name varchar2(30), age number); 
Create table Plant (plantid number primary key, name varchar2(30), sunlight number, water number, weight number); 
Create table planted (plantFK number, gardenerFK number, locationFK number, date1 date, seeds number, foreign key(plantFK) references plant(plantid), foreign key(gardenerFK) references gardener(gardenerid), foreign key(locationFK) references location(locationid)); 
Create table picked (plantFK number, gardenerFK number, locationFK number, date1 date, amount number, weight number, foreign key(plantFK) references plant(plantid), foreign key(gardenerFK) references gardener(gardenerid), foreign key(locationFK) references location(locationid));

1.Write a valid SQL statement that calculates the total weight of all corn cobs that were picked from the garden:

select sum(weight) Total from picked where plantfk = (select plantid from plant where name like "Corn");

17.54


2.For some reason Erin has change his location for picking the tomato to North. Write the corresponding query.

update picked set locationFK =(select locationid from location where name='North') where gardenerFK =( select gardenerid from gardener where name='Erin') and plantFK =(select plantid from plant where name='Tomato') ;

Query finished in 0.001 second(s). Rows affected: 1


3.Insert a new column 'Exper' of type Number (30) to the 'gardener' table which stores Experience of the of person. How will you modify this to varchar2(30).

alter table gardener add Exper number(30); 
alter table gardener modify column Exper number(30); 


4.Write a query to find the plant name which required seeds less than 20 which plant on 14-APR

select p.name from plant p join planted pt on p.plantid = pt.plantfk where pt.seeds < 20 and pt.date1 like '14-APR%';

Carrot


5.List the amount of sunlight and water to all plants with names that start with letter 'c' or letter 'r'.

select sunlight,water from plant where name like "C%" or name like "R%";

0.26	0.82
0.44	0.76
0.28	0.84

6.Write a valid SQL statement that displays the plant name and the total amount of seed required for each plant that were plant in the garden. The output should be in descending order of plant name.

select p.name,sum(pt.seeds) from plant p join planted pt on p.plantid=pt.plantfk group by p.name order by p.name desc;

Tomato	38
Radish	30
Lettuce	30
Corn	32
Carrot	42
Beet	36


7.Write a valid SQL statement that calculates the average number of items produced per seed planted for each plant type:( (Average Number of Items = Total Amount Picked / Total Seeds Planted.)

select p.name,(pk.amount/pt.seeds) avg_no_items from picked pk, planted pt,plant p where pk.plantfk=pt.plantfk and p.plantid=pt.plantfk group by p.name;

Carrot	2
Corn	4
Radish	0
Tomato	0

8.Write a valid SQL statement that would produce a result set like the following:

 name |  name  |    date    | amount 
------|--------|------------|-------- 
 Tim  | Radish | 2012-07-16 |     23 
 Tim  | Carrot | 2012-08-18 |     28 

select g.name,p.name,pk.date1 date,pk.amount from gardener g join picked pk on pk.gardenerfk=g.gardenerid join plant p on p.plantid=pk.plantfk where g.name="Tim" and pk.date1<='18-AUG-2012' order by p.name desc;


9.Find out persons who picked from the same location as he/she planted.

select g.name from gardener g join planted p on g.gardenerid=p.gardenerfk join picked pk on pk.plantfk=pk.plantfk where p.gardenerfk=pk.gardenerfk and p.locationfk=pk.locationfk group by name;

Father
Tim

10.Create a view that lists all the plant names picked from all locations except ’West’ in the month of August.

CREATE VIEW Pn AS SELECT p.name FROM plant p JOIN picked p1 ON p.plantid=p1.plantfk JOIN location l on l.locationid=p1.locationfk WHERE not(l.name="West" AND date1 like '%AUG%');
SELECT * FROM Pn;

Carrot

Corn
Tomato
